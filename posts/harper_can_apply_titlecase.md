# Harper Can Apply Title Case

In case you didn't know: Harper can convert text to title case! 
This has been around for a long time, but we haven't really talked about it publicly.
Being able to make text title case (strictly in accordance to Chicago Style) isn't a groundbreaking feature, but it is useful for certain niche applications.

For example, all the titles in this very blog are forced to title case on publish, which isn't something most CMS systems do.
I'd love to see it become more widespread.

We have [a live demo](https://writewithharper.com/titlecase) where you can try it out. It's also available [as part of `harper.js`](https://writewithharper.com/docs/harperjs/ref/harper.js.binarymodule.totitlecase.html), our JavaScript package.

[Soon], this will become a part of Harper's native linting capabilities.
