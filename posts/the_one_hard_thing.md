# The One Hard Thing

People (myself included) love to make cascading lists of tasks.
Actions, each of which are needed to improve a product, release a feature, or manage people.
These lists tend to explode in size, as more is asked of you.

There's one problem: I have only eight hours in a working day.
With so little time, how can I be expected to both maintain existing projects while consistently delivering new functionality?

## Insight

I've had two key insights that have led to some tremendous productivity gains.

**First:** I've observed that the difficulty of my tasks tends to follow a [Pareto distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution).
A small number of tasks are shockingly difficult to solve, while a much larger set boil down to communication.

**Second:** the morning is my most productive time of day.
For some reason, I'm able to tackle problems with an otherwise unusual mental clarity.
I suspect it's something to do with the natural human circadian rhythm or digestion.

## Leveraging the Pattern

Motivated by these two observations, I've developed a habit: I dedicate each morning to its own **difficult problem**.
This is a single task that is chosen specifically to stretch my limits.
I call this my daily **_one hard thing_**.

Previous examples:

- Developing the first version of [`harper-ls`](https://writewithharper.com/docs/integrations/language-server) which is now used by thousands of developers daily.
- Building the first 80% of the [Harper Obsidian plugin](https://writewithharper.com/docs/integrations/obsidian), which is also widely used.
- Grokking how [`Jetpack's Write Brief with AI`](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack) feature works (before I joined Automattic).
- Compiling Harper to WebAssembly and embedding it somewhere no one has put a grammar checker before: _inside the web browser_.

## Think About It

I implore you: think about how you work.
How is your energy affected by the things you do in the day-to-day?
If you enjoy your eight hours, maybe the rest will be better too.
