# Never Wait

I get it.
Opening a pull request is an intimidating proposition.

It is non-trivial to put your blood, sweat, and (let's be honest) tears into code and put that onto the internet for the world to see.
I remember my first pull-request: it wasn't pretty either.

But I want to highlight a couple reasons why I want potential contributors to open their pull requests as early as possible.

## Drafts Reduce Duplicate Work

When a contributor to a project is assessing the viability or usefulness of some work they're preparing to do,
most look at existing Pull Requests first.
Even if you're still working on the patch, it's a great idea to open a "draft" PR so no one starts work that could go to waste.

Further, if you have a draft open whose CI is failing, a maintainer may see it and fix whatever the problem may be.
I find myself frequently browsing [Harper's Pull Requests](https://github.com/Automattic/harper/pulls) looking for failing builds, since I'm often the best equipped to find the issue.

## It Helps With Debugging

I try to make myself available to contributors in case they have any questions regarding the architecture of Harper.
I'm also game to help debug their code, partly because I am of the opinion that debugging is a skill which is best learned by example.

But it is hard for me to debug code if I don't have it.
If a draft PR has been opened, I can usually see the problem without even cloning the code, since our CI is so comprehensive.

## Conclusion

So please don't wait; open that PR.
I am thrilled each time I see a name I don't recognize on GitHub notification.
