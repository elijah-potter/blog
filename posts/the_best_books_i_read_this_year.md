# The Best Books I Read This Year

This year I've been reading a lot more.
Is there a particular reason?
Other than simply admiring those that do, no.

I have found some gems of literature that I would like to share.

## [_Social Intelligence_ by Daniel Goleman](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d0a652d7-2461-46ce-9bf8-b684c45a67ea)

_Social Intelligence_ is truly a treasure.
I heard of Daniel Goleman's work first from an episode of [Talks at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hoo_dIOP8k) and later from psychologists who raved about his previous book, _Emotional Intelligence_.

It gives a deep dive into the subconscious and lightning-fast systems the underlay every social interaction.
As I read it, I found myself analyzing my own behavior, as well as the behavior of others.
As someone who has been overthinking my own social life from a young age, Daniel's advice to let my brain go to its default mode was relieving.

If you're the type to feel anxious in social situations, this book is perfect for you.

## [_Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow_ by Gabrielle Zevin](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d57e098f-82dc-41f1-94f3-8fcb02dfab1b)

_Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow_ is probably one of the best fiction books I've read.
**Period.**

At first glance, it is just the story of the careers of two game developers and their producer.
But if you dig a little bit **deeper**, it reveals itself to be the story of how the relationships between people who work together can be incredibly deep and complex.
Specifically, how the passion to create something can both bond and break people.

I don't think it is possible for me to accurately describe the emotional rollercoaster this book took me on.
Which is why you should read it!

## [_Why We Sleep_ by Matthew Walker](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/73e8dabf-d6bc-432e-98f0-a48e30a470ad)

I was curious why some people in my life sleep very little and other sleep quite a bit, both with varying levels of general wakefulness.
So, I ran a search: "Why do we sleep?"

To my surprise, I discovered someone wrote a book with almost that exact title.
Since I've read it, I've increased the duration of my sleep by nearly two hours.
This practice has had an outsize impact on my health and happiness.
I could not recommend it more.

I've [written about this book extensively](./the_optimal_workspace), so I won't repeat myself further.

## That's It!

I could wax poetic about these books and how they've changed me—but I won't.
In reality, I read them because I enjoyed reading them.
In an age where people [read less than ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3wJcF0t0bQ), I implore you: try picking up a book, **you might just like it**.
