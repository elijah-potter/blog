# The Art of the Talk

I've given dozens of talks over the years, yet I still feel like I have much to learn about public speaking.
The act of presenting an idea to a large audience in person is intimidating for me, as I imagine it is for most people.

Preparing for my upcoming talk at WordCamp US has me stopping to reflect on what I already know.
To recall the basic principles that turn a good talk into great one.

Conveying an idea effectively is a powerful skill. It can help get people on your side and direct them to your point of view.
Humans are beings that thrive when they build and maintain strong relationships with each other.
Good communication supercharges that process.

Here are my bold ideas for how to present ideas well, in no particular order.

## Convey Exactly One Idea At a Time

A common problem people run into when they draft a presentation is not a lack of ideas: It is that they have too many.

People adore talking about themselves or their ideas.
A natural consequence is that people have a predilection to stuff a presentation with more information than they need to make their point.
Make sure to allocate time to take stuff out.

The more streamlined and clear you make your point, the more receptive your audience will be.

## Use a Story

The human brain is wired for stories.
We've been telling them for thousands of years.
People remember them far better than they do arbitrary information.
In fact, that is exactly how communities used to do recordkeeping: by telling stories.

By weaving a tale into your presentation, you can prime the audience to receive your idea, and make that idea more memorable.

## Explain the "Why"

The "Why" should be the first thing your audience hears from you.
Why they should listen.
Why your idea is important.
Why your input can help them in their professional or personal lives.

Chris Anderson, the Head of TED, says, "Style without substance is awful".

In other words, you can have the fanciest, most visually appealing slide deck and all the confidence in the world, and you can still have a mediocre presentation.
Find a topic or idea that you genuinely care about, and explain why the audience should care about it too.
