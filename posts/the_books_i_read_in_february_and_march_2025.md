# The Books I Read in February and March 2025

In world containing TikTok, YouTube and a vast array of other apps that profit off human attention, it takes effort to place our focus on things that truly benefit our minds.

At least, that is what I would I say on LinkedIn as an explanation for why I read.
In reality: __I simply enjoy it__.

Each month I go back and summarize what I've learned from the books I've read.
In doing so, I've found that I get both deeper insights and greater joy from the literature.

### Wait! What's Up With February?

While I only finished one book in February, I started reading several others that I ended up finishing in March.
It only felt right to combine the two months into a single post.


## _The Dinner_ by Herman Koch

Someone convinced me to read this book based on its simple premise: the entire novel is an account of a single dinner. 
I was skeptical. 
It is a big book. 
How could they possibly fit that much plot into a single dinner?

The answer: Koch drip-feeds you information about the eclectic characters in attendance.
They gain an additional dimension that you couldn't achieve in another, more action-packed book.

I won't spoil anything here, but the ending was a complete surprise to me.
I did _not_ see that coming.

## _Gold_ by Isaac Asimov

I remember reading _Gold_ for the first time on a camping trip to the _Great Sand Dunes National Park_.
I was captivated by the dynamic short-stories contained within. 
At the time I believed them to be pure science fiction.

Reading _Gold_ for the second time revealed how wrong I was. 
More than one of the fictional ideas Asimov presents in the collection of short stories has since come to reality.

## _My Grandma Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry_ by Fredrik Backman

I'll admit: this novel was challenging to finish.

__Pros:__ the main character (an almost-eight year old girl) is expertly conveyed in the writing.
Backman makes clever use of run-on sentences to convey frustration, which is a literary device I've never seen before.
Further, the character has an unusual degree of insight into everyday aspects of life.
I found myself appreciating _my_ every day more placing myself in her shoes.

__Cons:__ it takes a long time for the insights to start coming.
An excessive degree of unimportant information is thrown at you right out of the gate.
I had difficulty maintaining my focus until the second half of the book (when stuff starts heating up).

## _Lessons in Chemistry_ by Bonnie Garmus

Garmus knocked it out of the park for her first novel.
It follows Elizabeth Zott, who, in all respects is the person I want to be when I grow up.

_Lessons in Chemistry_ is a testament to the value of subtraction.
The original manuscript of this book was about twice as long as the final published version.
The author was forced to condense it down after getting rejected from publisher after publisher.
And it shows.

I cannot capture the novel's elegance of prose, creativity in fiction, or importance in morality here.
__You need to read this book__.
