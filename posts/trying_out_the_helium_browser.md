# Trying Out the Helium Browser

![The Helium Website](/images/helium_website.png)

I've decided to give the [Helium browser](https://helium.computer/) a shot.
So far, I'm impressed!

For context, I've been an `ungoogled-chromium` user for the past 4-ish years.
Why? I like the privacy guarantees. Plus, I prefer to use the same browser engine as [my users](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/private-grammar-checker-h/lodbfhdipoipcjmlebjbgmmgekckhpfb).

When I heard about Helium, I was intrigued.
From what I can tell, it's essentially a fork of `ungoogled-chromium`, with some bonus perks.
It ships UBlock Origin out-of-the-box, which means I can keep using the same great ad blocker that Google recently killed in its browser.

It looks great, and migrating from Chromium was super easy.
