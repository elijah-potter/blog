# The Chrome Extension Supersedes the WordPress Plugin

Several months ago, I announced the initial version of the Harper WordPress plugin. In the interest of those still using it, I’d like to give y’all an update.

[The Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/private-grammar-checker-h/lodbfhdipoipcjmlebjbgmmgekckhpfb) is now the recommended way to use Harper in WordPress. There are several compounding reasons for this. Most importantly, iterating on a Chrome extension is significantly faster than the review process for WordPress.com plugins. In fact, the current WordPress.com Harper plugin, which you may already be using in your P2s, is currently several months out-of-date. While you may continue to use the WordPress plugin, it will no longer receive regular updates.

If you choose to switch to the Chrome extension, I think you’ll find the experience more holistic, since it is able to persist user data across sites.
