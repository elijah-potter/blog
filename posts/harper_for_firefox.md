# Harper for Firefox

![The Harper Firefox Extension](/images/harper_chrome_ext.png)

There's a great deal of overlap between those who use Harper and those who use Firefox.
Foremost, they both value _privacy_.
Which is why I'm so thrilled to say that Harper has an official plugin for Firefox.
While there has been an unofficial one for [a while now](./harper_for_firefox_through_spellbolt), this is the one that fully deserves the Harper label. It's ours, through and through.

It's still early days, so if you run into problems, feel free to open [an issue](https://github.com/Automattic/harper/issues/new/choose).

If you'd like to install it, pay us a visit on the [Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/private-grammar-checker-harper/).
