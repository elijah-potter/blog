# Speaking at WordCamp U.S. in August

I was recently encouraged to submit a talk proposal to the AI track at WordCamp US.
I was more than happy to oblige, and to my surprise, I got in.
See description below for details. I hope to see some of y'all there!

## Description

Machine learning has been around for decades.
Until recently, running ML models typically required big centralized servers due to high computational demands.
With modern hardware and tools like Rust and Burn, we can flip the script.
When run on a user's device, trained models can be an incredible boost to human creativity and expression. 

Harper is a grammar checker that is designed to improve your work without degrading your integrityâ€”or the writing experience itself.
Our users generate and publish novel ideas faster because we focus on what's important: speed, privacy, and accuracy.

WordPress' mission is to democratize publishing.
This talk will explore how we can use AI to democratize writing too.
More importantly, how you can train and deploy specialized models at the edge to eliminate inference costs, lower latency, and improve user satisfaction.
