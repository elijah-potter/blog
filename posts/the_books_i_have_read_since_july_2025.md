# The Books I Have Read Since July of 2025

Whenever I can, I try to stop and reflect.
Often it's about my work and the things I can do to continue being more productive.
But often, I reflect about the recent books I have read and the things I (and you) can learn from them.
That's what this post will hopefully turn out to be. 

So, without further ado, here are some of the books I have read recently.

## _The Stoic Challenge_ by William B. Irvine

At the end of each episode of his podcast, Ezra Klein asks his guests the same question: _what three books would you recommend we read?_
Terminating [one particular episode](https://pca.st/q3l0grkv), author Jonathan Haidt suggests _The Stoic Challenge_.

I was already aware of William B. Irvine as a prolific stoic writer. 
In fact, I had tried to read another of his books on the subject of Stoic philosophy.
I had not finished it because, well, I found it somewhat dry.

_The Stoic Challenge_, on the other hand, was a delight.
It feels like Irvine took all the successful parts of the previous book and condensed them down into something my Gen-Z brain could understand.

The book's more important takeaway is simple.
In life, you and I both encounter daily struggles that impede our progress toward our goals.

Our flight is running late, so we get to our hotel later than we intend.
We forget to pack a lunch, so we must get through our workday hungry.
Our babysitter wants a raise, which means we won't be able to go out as often.

_The Stoic Challenge_ encourages us to frame these setbacks as a test.
A test put upon us by some hidden force.
To pass the test, we need to act in a rational way, and take steps to avoid exacerbating the resulting negative emotions.

I highly suggest anyone read this book.
I felt engaged the entire time reading it, and its lessons apply to any walk of life.

## _Slow Productivity_ by Cal Newport

Cal Newport is known for many of the most groundbreaking productivity books of the last decade.
Personally, _Deep Work_ and _How to Be a Straight-A Student_ have been particularly impactful.
They've encouraged me to cut out the unnecessarily complex parts of my working life, and work to find ways of doing the same for others.

His latest work continues from the same ideas he put forth in those books.

_How to be a Straight-A Student_ was focused on the idea that the quantity of high-quality, published work made the difference between mediocre and stellar academic careers.
Following on, _Deep Work_ made the case that the best way to achieve high output was by creating circumstances that allowed for extended periods of intense focus.

_Slow Productivity_ takes both of those ideas a step further.
He suggests that the key to high-quality output, in addition to deep focus, requires time.
He believe that truly amazing products require the brain to be relaxed, comfortable, and unhurried.
It is only then, that it can work outside of the box.

I'm not entirely sure I agree, but the book made for a stimulating read nonetheless.

## _The Humans_ by Matt Haig

_The Humans_ is a beautiful book that celebrates all the idiosyncratic things that make humans special.
Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you
I've read a decent number of Haig's books in the past, and I've enjoyed each one.
This was no different.

I'll spare you the details.

## _The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing_

I am an engineer.
I went to an engineering school.
Since I spend most of my time around people who work in fields related to engineering, I do not spend much time around people who know a lot about marketing.
I wanted to fix that. Which is why I read _The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing._

This is a book intended for people who want to understand the axioms of how brands are perceived by the public.

## _Sapiens_ by Yuval Noah Harari

_Sapiens_ is a comprehensive history of our species, _homo sapiens_, beginning with the first humans to walk the planet all the way up to the humans of today.
Harari takes a unique look at what makes our species special, and the things that make our future uncertain.

At times, the writing can be a bit dry and repetitive, but on the whole it is a well-written book.
I would certainly recommend it for anyone who seeks an entirely new perspective on the short history of human life.

## _Your Utopia_ by Bora Chung

I went into _Your Utopia_ expecting a collection of short stories similar to those by Ted Chiang.
That is not what I received.

Instead, Chung provides a somewhat eclectic collection of stories that feel not unlike a fever dream.
Rather than genuine, hard science fiction, Chung tells the tales of sentient cars, elevators that care for the elderly, and immortal secretaries.

I don't regret reading it, but I also don't recommend it to fans of Chiang.
