## What We Can Learn from New York City

Today marks the end of my first week in New York City. It is an exceptionally active place. Neither the hustle nor the bustle ever stops. Sirens sound at all hours of the day and you're constantly smelling entirely new things. I've been told New York is an acquired taste. I can see why they might say that.

Back home, it's rare I would walk down the street and overhear a random founder talk about their latest Y Combinator funding round. Here, it's apparently common enough to occur at least once a week. Everywhere I look, I find the headquarters of multinational companies and the offices of major governmental organizations.

### The City is Practical

If I were to describe Portland, Oregon (which I visited a few weeks ago to attend WordCamp US) in one word, it would be optimistic. If I were to describe New York in one word, based on my incredibly limited experience thus far, it would be practical.

The city and the people who reside inside take very little fluff. They say things as they are, in the kindest way possible. If they don't think your proposed route to a restaurant will work, they stop you before you finish explaining and put you on the right track. It saves everyone time and energy.

This is something I personally need to practice more often in my work. It is common for me to avoid productive conversations or code reviews, only because they might evoke a negative emotion in the short-term. These same conversations usually produce positive emotions in the long term, so it is in my interest and in my colleague's interest to have them. NYC is slowly training a habit to recognize these situations more often and make the right decision.

I don't think I'm alone here. I think a plurality of people in the modern world could benefit from a bolder mindset that takes on tough conversations, rather than shying away.

### We're Not Done Yet

I'll be in New York for another week. If all goes well, I'll have more opportunities to learn from the other members of the AI group. It's been great to hang out with James and the gang. The culture here is incredibly inviting. I am immensely grateful to be here.
