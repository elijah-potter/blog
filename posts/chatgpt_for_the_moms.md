# ChatGPT for the Moms

My mom is a violently intelligent woman.
But she lives in the unfortunate reality of not being a software engineer or mathematician.
While she is just as excited about ChatGPT (and all the other nascent AI technology) as the rest of us, she isn't aware of the unintelligent pitfalls artificial intelligence has these days.

If you're mom is experimenting with ChatGPT, I'd highly recommend sending this list to her.
Powerful technology is in their hands, but I've got three things they should know before relying on it.

## Advice for Moms

### Use Web Search

My mother recently learned how to make cobbler.
She adored asked ChatGPT questions about the recipe, and how she could improve it using the ingredients she had on hand.
Unfortunately, she was getting subtly wrong information from the bot, so the cobbler turned out "sub-par".
This can be solved by using ChatGPT's web search.

When you open up ChatGPT on a phone or on a computer, you'll be met with the familiar chat window. 
If you ask it questions it will give you an answer.
Sometimes that answer will be good, sometimes not.

You can generally get better information if you enable the web search tool.

This will allow ChatGPT to do Google searches on your behalf.
It improves the quality of information it gives you, while only adding a second or two to their response.

### It Is Not Your Friend

When we see a chat window, our first thought is that there's a person on the other end.
Someone with emotions and lives all their own.
That is not the case here.

ChatGPT, while an advanced machine learning model, is not a person.
It does not replace real human connection.
It can't watch your kids when you've got an emergency.
It won't show up to the school recital.
It doesn't care about you—despite what it says.

There's a lot that goes into a genuine social connection, all of which are missing from ChatGPT.

### Use Your Brain

ChatGPT is no substitute for critical thought.

It cannot do most things, even if it claims it can.
You are a capable human being—able to accomplish anything you put your mind to.
While ChatGPT can be a helpful assistant or brainstorming partner, don't let it steer the ship.

## What to Remember

While ChatGPT can be a powerful tool in the right hands, it is important to remember it is just that: a tool.
It can be enhanced with the right settings, it is not real human connection, and it can't replace your brain.
Use it well and use it wisely.
