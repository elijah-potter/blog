# The Books I Read in January 2025

I only got to read two full books this month.
The first was a short novel by Matt Haig with the title [_The Midnight Library_.](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d9c7ed04-6148-4e01-a118-d96cba16f507)

It reads like and feels like a therapy session.
I quite enjoyed it, but I'm not sure it is for everyone.

The second book (and the one I got the most value from) was [_Working in Public: the Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2505f748-ac12-41fb-a411-0868cbe3694c) by Nadia Eghbal.
Until now, I've largely organized Harper in ways inspired by projects like Vite and Rust that I interact with on a daily basis.

Eghbal gives a more holistic view than mine, written for an external observer.
This book was especially interesting due to the comprehensive coverage of "open" projects with no code at all.
She seems to believe the OSS software management problem is one of social complexity, not technical complexity.

Furthermore, Nadia makes the case that synchronous communication, while often a burden on maintainer attention, is usually necessary.
