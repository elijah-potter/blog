# Harper in the News

The biggest complaint about Harper is that the quality of grammar checking still needs some work.
I've got an exciting new project I'm preparing to discuss later this week (hopefully) in that area.
It should be a step-function improvement over our previous methods for creating new rules.

In the meantime, I've collected some recent sightings of Harper in the wild:
