# On Linkarzu's YouTube

I consider myself an avid member of the Neovim community.
As a whole, they have a great pulse on what a good writing experience feels like.
Over time, this community has grown into a real force in the software engineering field.

Linkarzu has been a constant presence in this ecosystem for a while, giving a voice to the hidden 
maintainers that make Neovim great.
I am honored to be counted among the guests he has hosted on his channel.

We talked at length about [Harper](https://writewithharper.com), open source maintenance, and the tooling we use in our development workflows.
