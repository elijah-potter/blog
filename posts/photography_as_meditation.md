# Photography as Meditation

The goal of meditation is to become more mindful and aware.
For me, it is often an attempt to get an appreciation for my surroundings—to see how utterly complex the world is.

Photography does something similar for me.
The heft of the camera in my hands reminds me to slow down and take in the view.

My mother is a photographer—a great one at that.
She's been in the business for at least as long as I've been alive.
She tells me something similar: the act of framing a picture is itself a way to understand your subject better.
