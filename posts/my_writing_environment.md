# My Writing Environment

Writing is one of life's greater joys.
It's a mental workout that often brings me a level of clarity that is hard to find elsewhere.

As software engineers, isn't that part of our modus operandi?

Well, that's exactly what I've done.
Over the years, I've spend a unruly amount of time tweaking and changing the tools I use to write.

I'll simply say that Harper is a grammar checker that happens to work exceptionally well in Neovim.

### [Zen Mode](https://github.com/folke/zen-mode.nvim)

Plain Neovim organizes each file to cover the maximum amount of space on-screen. 
Practically, this means most of my text ends up on the left side, which can hurt my neck.
Zen mode restricts the width of the file and centers it on the screen.

If you're thirsty for _all_ the details, take a quick look on [GitHub](https://github.com/elijah-potter/dots/tree/master/nvim).

## ReMarkable 2

A few years ago, while I was in school, I splurged and purchased a used Remarkable 2.
Now, there is still rarely a day goes by that I don't use it.
Sure, everything it does could be easily approximated by paper.
On the other hand, it
