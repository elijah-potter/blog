# A Harper Record

When we started work on [`harper.js`](https://writewithharper.com/docs/harperjs/introduction), our goal was simple.
We wanted it to take less than 24 hours for a developer to embed high-quality grammar checking in their app.

A friend of mine, [Lukas Werner](https://lukaswerner.com/) recently set a record for this.
In just over 15 minutes, he was able to embed Harper into Raycast, a command palate for MacOS.

This is fantastic news.
It's always great to see when your goals are having a real impact on someone's ability.

I hope you take the time to look at [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/lukasmwerner/harper-raycast).

In other news, we have some other small projects using Harper:

- [Lockbook](https://github.com/lockbook/lockbook)
- [Stubby CMS](https://stubby.io/)
