# Some New Projects Are Using Harper

I recently did some snooping ([through Dependabot](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/)) on what open source projects have been using Harper.
Since I last checked, there are some new ones.
I wonder if the recent additions have anything to do with [Harper going `1.0`](./harper_turns_1.0_today).

- [Stencila](https://github.com/stencila/stencila)
- [Gherlint](https://github.com/gherlint/gherlint)
- [walletbeat](https://github.com/walletbeat/walletbeat)
- [fixmyspelling](https://github.com/samedwardes/fixmyspelling)

[Someone also wrote a book using Harper.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1nfks80/oh_my_god_its_done_an_entire_book_written_in/)
