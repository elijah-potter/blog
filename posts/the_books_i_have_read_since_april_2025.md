# The Books I Have Read Since April 2025

It has been a slow couple of months for my reading habit.
Although, now that I've said that out loud, I realize I say that every time.
I never quite read enough books by the time I feel ready to write one of these reading reviews.

In the interest of brevity, let's jump straight in.

## _How to Stop Time_ by Matt Haig

After reading _The Midnight Library_ in [January](/the_books_i_read_in_january_2025), I was thoroughly impressed by Haig's work.
I wanted more, but wasn't sure what to read next.
So, the next time I saw a book with an interesting title which happened to be his, I picked it up.

If _The Midnight Library_ was a literary therapy session, _How to Stop Time_ is a history lesson. 
It follows a man who ages at one-tenth the rate of a normal human.
Despite being given the gift of extra life, he regularly falls into spats of depression when his loved ones die before him.

While Haig's writing continues to be sentimental and appreciative of the small things in life (a trait few seem to possess these days), I ultimately found the book predictable and unengaging.
It was a good book, and I felt satisfied having read it, I had put it down for a few days at a time more than once to do so.
If you're going to read just one of Haig's books, it shouldn't be this one.

## _Everything is Tuberculosis_ by John Green

I've been a fan of John Green's work since I was kid.
I remember reading _Looking for Alaska_ as I cruised down the Mississippi River on a school trip.
It was one of the most memorable books (and expeditions) I've had the pleasure of experiencing.

Naturally, I was ecstatic to hear John Green published something new: _Everything is Tuberculosis_, a book about the facets of our lives (of which there are many) that we can thank TB for.

I liked this book, but I don't think it matches the reflective attitude about the human experience you find in his other booksâ€”but that's a good thing!
_Everything is Tuberculosis_ is not a book you're supposed to relate to, but a book that tells a story about a life most in the western world find completely unfamiliar.
One where each and every day is counted.
One where the price of a medication is the most important number.
One where you might not survive.

The fact that I couldn't relate to the events in _Everything is Tuberculosis_ is the exact reason why I'm glad I read it.

## _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ by Dale Carnegie

I read _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ (a mouthful, I know) not because I needed advice on the subject.
I read it because I believe this book to be a telling window into the minds of the businessmen of the early 20th century.

I've been told that this book is still relevant today; that the advice still works. 
I disagree.
The priorities, values, and culture are entirely different today than when this book was written.
I found it fascinating to compare and contrast between my own experience and the author's.
