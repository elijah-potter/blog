# Always Think of the Hook First

![A log I found in the Indian Peaks Wilderness](/images/log.webp)

In his popular book, _Outliers_, Malcolm Gladwell made the case that there was one number that predicted your skill level in a field: the number of hours of dedicated practice.
In popular culture, this idea has been simplified.
Some think that if you just do something for 10,000 hours, then you'll become a world-class expert.
This is false.

What does the word "dedicated" mean in the phrase "dedicated" practice?
It means applying focused, deliberate thought to it.
It means reflecting on your own performance.
It means seeking help from masters in the field.
Above all, it means __achieving mastery is not easy__.

I aim to master the skill of writing.
In my free time this week, I've been working on my deliberate practice of writing.
In doing so, I've come to some conclusions.
If you'd like to join me in pursuing mastery of the written word, here's what I think you should do.

## Proof it Yourself

Two-time Pulitzer prize-winner David McCullough says "Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard."

Because the act of writing is also the act of thinking, the process of revising text clarifies thought.
I personally find that my argument when I first touch my keyboard usually stands in stark contrast to when I hit "publish."

Heavy-handed revision tools like ChatGPT actively disrupt this great benefit of the revision process.
Sure, they can rewrite tone to be more attractive online, but they also rob you of the opportunity to develop your concept.
That's why I turn everything else off and only use Harper: because it gets out of the way of what I am trying to say.
__You can't reflect on what you've written if you are not the one reflecting.__

## Read The Work of Great Writers

When I sit down to write after spending time online, I feel deflated.
The competition of social media and the churn of the news cycle both lead to poor prose.

When I sit to write after reading Bonnie Garmus or Cal Newport, I feel invigorated.
I can imagine a shape for the words on the page which precisely captures the ideas I'm trying to communicate.
Reading great literature gives you an intuition for what your own work should look like.

## Think of the Hook First

In rapper circles, it's a common point of debate whether to think of the verse first or the hook.

One one hand, the verse is the substance of the song. 
It contains the message, the detail, and the personal meaning.
Music derives much of its complexity from the verse.
On the other hand, the hook is what gets people to listen.
It is what makes them stop flicking through Spotify and fall into the beat.

If you're writing for an audience, you have a lot of competition for their attention.
Spend more time on the introduction than anything else.
It should capture your readers, delight their imaginations, and put them in your shoes.

## Don't Get Attached

I spent a long time on a post similar to this one.
I was quite proud of it, for I had spent hours adding layers of detail and quite a few case studies from my own work.
Alas, Gutenberg decided it was not meant to be and chucked it into oblivion.

Although I was initially crestfallen from the loss, I now believe the second round ended up even better.
To truly revise your work, you'll inevitably have to delete parts of it.
Get comfortable with that.
