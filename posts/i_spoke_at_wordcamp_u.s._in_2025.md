# I Spoke at WordCamp U.S. in 2025

I had the incredible opportunity to speak at WordCamp U.S. at [Matt](https://ma.tt)'s suggestion.
I met a number of wonderful, kind, and inviting people.
It was my first WordCamp and first conference talk, so I was naturally nervous.
The community made it feel easy.

I spoke about how we can use machine learning to improve the quality of our applications without big capital expenditures.
In fact, I argue that capital expenditures are often a step in the wrong direction.
