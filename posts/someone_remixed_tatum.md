# Someone Remixed Tatum

A while back, I wrote a small tool, dubbed "Tatum", for rendering Markdown to HTML for use alongside Neovim.
I've continued to use it to this day, with a few tweaks here and there.

It looks like someone has taken advantage of Tatum's open-source license and remixed it into something even more capable.
