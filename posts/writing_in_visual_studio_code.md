# Writing in Visual Studio Code

I [write this blog in Neovim](./my_writing_environment_as_a_software_engineer), and I'm aware of a good number of other nerds who do the same.
I suppose I never considered that people might use other code editors for writing prose.
In fact, it seems that there are a nontrivial number of people using [Harper in Visual Studio Code](https://chriswiegman.com/2026/01/harper-my-new-grammar-checker/).
They seem to be using Harper mostly for Markdown and comments in code, but I'd love to get $\LaTeX$ working as well.
